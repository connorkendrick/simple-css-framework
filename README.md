# Simple CSS Framework
This is a simple, 12-column CSS grid framework that also contains normalize.css, to please all of your cross-browser needs. This was inspired by the HTML/CSS tutorial over on Udacity, and by working with this extremely rudimentary framework, I'll be able to better understand and use the various CSS frameworks that are out there. :thumbsup:
